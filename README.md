Problem Statement : Yulu, India's leading micro-mobility service provider, has seen significant revenue dips and wants to understand the factors influencing demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Dataset Exploration: • Import the dataset and examine its structure. • Check for missing values, data types, and basic statistics. • Understand the distribution of each variable.
Relationship between Variables: • Investigate relationships between the dependent variable (Count of rental bikes) and independent variables (Workingday, Weather, Season, etc.). • Visualize relationships using scatter plots, box plots, or correlation matrices.
Statistical Tests: • Determine the significance of variables in predicting electric cycle demand. • Perform 2-sample t-tests to compare rental counts on working days vs. non-working days. • Use ANOVA to assess differences in rental counts across different seasons and weather conditions. • Consider chi-square tests to examine relationships between weather and season.
Hypothesis Testing: • Set up null hypotheses (H0) and alternative hypotheses (H1) for each test. • Check assumptions of normality and equal variance using visualizations and statistical tests. • Define a significance level (alpha) for hypothesis testing.
Test Statistics and Decision Making: • Calculate test statistics for each hypothesis test. • Based on the calculated p-values, make decisions to accept or reject the null hypotheses.
Inference: • Interpret the results of hypothesis tests and statistical analyses. • Provide insights into the significant factors influencing electric cycle demand in the Indian market. • Make recommendations based on the findings to improve Yulu's business strategy and revenue performance. By performing thorough exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing, we aim to identify key factors driving demand for shared electric cycles and provide actionable insights for Yulu to enhance its business operations and address revenue challenges.
